# Border type. Options are VANILLA, which uses the vanillia-style board or BARRIER,
# which uses particles and barrier blocks. If players have permission to use the barrier type
# they may override this option. If they do not have permission or lose the permission
# then this setting will be used.
type: VANILLA

# Teleport players back inside the border if they somehow get outside.
# This will teleport players back inside if they toggle the border with a command.

# Place a safety block under the player if they get teleported back into a non-safe spot.

# 
# Turn on barrier by default.
show-by-default: true
#

# Barrier offset.
# The barrier normally occurs at the protection range limit but this value extends it outwards.
# This does not extend the protection range, but will enable players to go outside their protected area.
# The barrier will not go further than the island distance. Minimum and default value is 0.
